# Imu Filter
Yet another IMU filter. 

This filter does the following:
* transform IMU message from one tf frame to another
* autodetect tf parameter, when standing still


# other Filters
There are also some other filters out there (which I didn't find sufficient for our use case):
* [IMU Tools](wiki.ros.org/imu_tools)
* [IMU Pipeline](wiki.ros.org/imu_pipeline)
* [IMU Pipeline from dawonn](https://github.com/dawonn/imu_pipeline)
